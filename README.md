# Matrix-Multiplication-Implementations
uses three different algorithms to implement matrix multiplication calculations.

This class will use three different algorithms to compute matrix multiplication. 
The first  one is the original way, using three four loops. The second way uses 
recursion to break down the matrix to a 2x2 and computes the multiplication that way. 
The last one uses Strassen's Algorithm to do one less multiplication when braking down the matrix,
which results in improving the run time (can be proven with recurrence relation).
